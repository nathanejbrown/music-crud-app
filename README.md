# Music Crud App

## This is a project that I did as practice writing a full-stack application. The database is written in postgreSQL with a node.js server, and the front end utilizes server-side templating with Nunjuks.

### Everything is hosted through heroku and visible at http://music-crud-app.herokuapp.com/songs
